#### LLM-Integrated Quiz for DailyCode
##### Summary
DailyCode is a core feature of 100xDevs, designed to help developers practice and refine their coding skills. This project aims to integrate an LLM into DailyCode so that for every new module added, the LLM automatically generates quizzes. Additionally, there will be a dedicated quiz section where time-based quizzes are created, allowing users to test their understanding effectively.

##### Expected outcomes
- LLM integration to generate quizzes dynamically for each module.
- A separate quiz section with time-based quizzes.
- A structured database for quiz storage and tracking user progress.
- A well-documented and scalable implementation.

##### Implementation
This project will require integrating an LLM API into the DailyCode platform. The implementation will include designing a robust quiz generation system, building a UI for the quiz section, and ensuring the quizzes align with the added modules. The backend will store quiz data, track progress, and manage timing logic.
